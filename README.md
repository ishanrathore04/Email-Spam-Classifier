# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project is a spam email classifier built using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails based on their content. It can be used to automatically filter incoming emails and identify potentially unwanted or harmful messages.
